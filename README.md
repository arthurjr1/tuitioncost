# [Average Cost of Undergraduate Tuition in the United States](https://arthurjr1.github.io/tuitioncost/#5)

This topic was chosen for a data analysis class assignment, a recorded audio-visual presentation. The analysis of the average cost of tuition in the United States was done in `Rmarkdown` to test out my skills with visualization. The cost of college tuition continues to increase and with the debate over student loan debt, I decided to look at the last ten years prior to the overall tuition trend for colleges across the U.S. The presentation was short with slide and minutes restrictions, but I included a description of the data and two analysis slides.

The slides included: the data I chose for the class assignment Analysis 1: Yearly cost Analysis 2: Yearly cost for public and private college Analysis slides were required to include a visual representation of the data (e.g., bar chart, box plot, whatever) and basic information and plots using the `tidyverse` package `patchwork`.
